# ProjectLlama

This a project fork from my group project along with my own improvement and vision. 

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/cheneus/ProjectLlama
```

### Prerequisites

Move into the folder that you have cloned and run : 

```
yarn install
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
yarn install v1.5.1
[1/5] Validating package.json...
[2/5] Resolving packages...
$ (cd client && yarn) && (cd server && yarn)
```

This shows you what command that I am prompting yarn to do. In this case, it is going go into the folder, server & client to execute yarn install to install the required modules. If everything is installed or updated. It will show "success"
```
success Already up-to-date.
```
